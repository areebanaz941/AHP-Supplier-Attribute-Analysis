# AHP-Supplier-Attribute-Analysis
This project uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate and rank suppliers based on multiple criteria such as serviceability, capacity, quality, and cost. It calculates the priority index for each criterion, ensures consistency with the Consistency Ratio, and ranks suppliers accordingly.

## Project Overview
This project automates the supplier evaluation process using AHP by:

- Computing the priority index for each attribute.
- Calculating the consistency ratio to ensure the model's validity.
- Determining the priority index of suppliers based on multiple criteria.
- Ranking suppliers based on their performance in various attributes.

  
## Project Features
- Priority Index Calculation: Calculates the priority index for each attribute.
- Consistency Ratio: Ensures that the decision-making process is consistent.
- Supplier Ranking: Ranks suppliers based on multiple attributes like serviceability, capacity, quality, and cost.
- Data Visualization: Visualizes data for a clearer understanding of results.


## Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language.
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: Numerical operations.
- matplotlib: Data visualization.
- seaborn: Enhanced data visualizations.

## Results
After running the script, youâ€™ll see supplier rankings based on AHP analysis, along with data visualizations to better understand the results.
