# AHP-Supplier-Attribute-Analysis
This project uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate and rank suppliers based on multiple criteria such as serviceability, capacity, quality, and cost. It calculates the priority index for each criterion, ensures consistency with the Consistency Ratio, and ranks suppliers accordingly.
